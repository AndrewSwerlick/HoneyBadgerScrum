        A honey badger appears in a running gag in the 1989 film The Gods Must Be Crazy II
The viral video Crazy Nastyass Honey Badger became a popular Internet meme in 2011, attaining over 57 million views on YouTube as of February 2013. The video features footage from the Nat Geo WILD network of honey badgers fighting jackals, invading beehives, and eating cobras. The video includes a comical voiceover by "Randall" in a vulgar, effeminate, and sometimes exasperated narration, including lines like "Honey badger don't care!" and "Honey badger don't give a sh...!" Randall subsequently published the book Honey Badger Don't Care in the same year. The video has been referenced in an episode of the popular television series Glee and commercials for the video game Madden NFL 12 and Wonderful Pistachios. The video has also influenced references to honey badgers on the show American Pickers. In Alvin and the Chipmunks: Chipwrecked, a honeybadger makes a brief appearance.
Australian Wallabies and Western Force rugby player Nick Cummins nickname is "Honey Badger", drawn from his attitude towards strong defence and based on the above internet meme.
Former LSU Tigers' football player Tyrann Mathieu's nickname is "The Honey Badger". The nickname became popular during the 2011 college football season, when it was often referenced in the national media. "He takes what he wants" said CBS sportscaster Verne Lundquist of Mathieu, in reference to the Internet meme
